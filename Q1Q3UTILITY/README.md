1. Install Python 3.x (only tested with this)
2. Extract all texture folders from your .pk3 files into one texture folder in the Q1Q3UTILITY folder
	Should look something like this, keeping the sub folder structure
	..\Q1Q3UTILITY\textures\base_door
	..\Q1Q3UTILITY\textures\gothic_block
3. Install easygui with pip
4. Open a commando prompt and start the application with 'python q1q3utilityGUI.py'
	With this approach you will see some debug messages, else it should 
	also work by just opening the q1q3utilityGUI.py with python
5. If other textures should be added to the config file please look for duplicates and use only 15 charactors in the final name
